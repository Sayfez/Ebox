Our project consists of designing and deploying a student presence management system
 using the Internet of Things (IoT), artificial intelligence (AI), and web applications. We inte
grate technologies such as RFID chips, ESP32 microcontrollers, and Raspberry Pi nano com
puters to create sensor networks in classrooms. Each student receives an RFID card and records
 his presence via a card reader at the entrance of the room. The data is transmitted in real time
 to a central web platform, allowing managers to track attendance and generate reports. The
 web application offers advanced features such as schedule management, absence notification,
 and statistics generation. This system meets the need for attendance management in higher
 education while providing an intuitive user experience.
